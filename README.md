#Introduction 
The main source code for the first-year university PROM module. This project is the 'pick' system, where we have to use an I2C device and some hardware to create a system that is able to break into the lock system we had to create.

#Build and Test
Due to the simplicity and time contraints, we will skip the unittesting that the main lock system had. Instead, we will just use the normal build script but test the software against sample hardware to ensure functionality.
